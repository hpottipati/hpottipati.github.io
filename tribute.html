            <p>Born Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, Mahatma Gandhi was and Indian politician and activist who helped
                free India from British rule. He was known as Mahatma to followers, which means "Great Soul".
                He began activism once he saw mistreatment of Indians in South Africa.

            <h2>Major Achievements: <br></h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The laws that Britain had didn't allow Indians to collect or sell salt. If they wanted to buy salt,
                    they had to do so with a high tax. To protest against, this he organized a march with 78 of his
                    followers to the town of Dandi.
                    As the march went on, more people joined him. As Gandhi picked up the first clump of salt, thousands
                    of other people from nearby cities joined him
                </li>
                <li>Gandhi also partook in many hunger-strikes. One of his notable ones was in 1932.
                    While he was in jail, he started a Hunger Strike to protest the British's decision to divide India's
                    electoral system by caste. He also fasted to protest the British government giving the Untouchables
                    caste their separate political representation </li>
