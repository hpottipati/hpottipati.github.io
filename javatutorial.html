                        Java is an object oriented programming language based off of C and C++. Released in 1995, it has
                        grown to huge popularity, and is now the most used programming language in the world
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Just like other OOP languages, Java also has implementations of
                        Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The class name should match up to the name of the file that you are running your code is in
                    </li>
                    <li>All the code on this page is able to be run in any IDE or any java-enabled command prompt.
                        Please try these by yourself to really understand them</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.maketecheasier.com/run-java-program-from-command-prompt/" id="tutorial" target="_blank">Click here</a> to
                        read an article on how to setup java and the command prompt to turn java programs</li>

                </ul>
                <p>One of the first things you create when you learn a language is "Hello World" Program</p>
                <pre> <code>
                class HelloWorld{
                    public static void main(String args[]){
                        System.out.println("Hello World");
                    }
                }
            </code>
        </pre>

                <li>Side note: Using // is a way to make comments in java. I will be using them to explain lines of code
                    in the following sections</li>

            <section id="Variables" class="main-section">
                <div class="sectiontitle">Variables</div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Variables are places where data is stored</li>
                    <li>There are many types of Variables, like int, double, boolean, and String. All of these store a
                        different
                        type of data. Let's take a look at a program that shows variables in action</li>
                </ul>

                <pre>  <code>
                class intVariables{      
                    public static void main(String args[]){
                        int num; //Create an integer variable named num
                        num = 10; //Assign num to a value of 10                
                        System.out.println("Num is: " + num); // Print out Num is: 10, this is because we assigned num to 10 in the previous line
                        //The way to combine things when they are being printed is to put a plus sign 
                        num = num * 2; //set the value of num to twice itself. 10 * 2 = 20. Num is now equal to 20. 
                        System.out.println("Num is now: " + num); //Print out Num is now: 20
                    } 
                }
            </code> </pre>
                <p>Result: <br> Num is: 10 <br> Num is now: 20</p>
                <p>Another way to create variables is <em>type name = value;</em></p>
                <p>In the previous code, we learned about integer variables, now let's learn about String variables</p>
                <p>Strings are lines of text and represented by double quotes around them. In fact, in the first Hello
                    World
                    program, "Hello World" is a string!</p>
                <pre> <code>
                class stringVariables{ 
                    public static void main(String args[]){
                        String x = "Hi"; // Create String variable named x that stores "Hi"
                        String y = "There";// Create String variable named x that stores "There". 
                        System.out.println(x + y);//Prints out x and y ("Hi" and "There") combined. 
                    } 
                }
            </code></pre>
                The Result will be: HiThere. This happens because there is no space between the Strings.
                While in the println line, there is space between x and y, this space doesn't mean anything because
                there isn't a string signifying a space. <br><code>System.out.println(x + "" + y);</code> adds a space
                between the two strings and therefore the result will be: Hi There.

                <div class="sectiontitle">Control Statements</div>
                <p>Control Statements control where a code run based on if a condition is true or false
                    This is done with the if, else if, and else Statements. The condition is done with relational
                    operators.
                    These compare two values.</p>

            </code></pre>
                <p>Let's change this up a little bit by using the else statement. The code under else, runs
                    when all the other conditions are not true.</p><br>
                <pre>  <code>

                int x = 1;// initializes int named x and sets it to 1.
                int y = 2;// initializes int named y and sets it to 2.
                if(x > y) System.out.println("y is greater than x"); // Checks if y is greater than x. It is not, so the code doesn't run. However, there is an else statement.   
                else System.out.println("The other conditions are false");// Since the first condition isn't true,  this else block runs and prints out The other conditions are false. 
                    } 
                }
            </code></pre>
                <p>We can use more than one condition using the <code>else if</code>
                    statement</p>

                class ifAndElseIfAndElseControl{

                else System.out.println("The other conditions are false"); // Since the above else if condition is true, this statement doesn't run.

                <p>You first initialize a variable and set it to value. Then you make a
